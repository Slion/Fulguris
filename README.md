# Contribute

## Test

Please report issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/slion/fulguris/issues).

## Code
Code contributions are of course welcome, both bug fix and features.
Please understand that code quality, design and architecture are extremely important as the foremost priority of this project is to deliver a premium browsing experience.
We do our best to avoid treating users as beta testers. Therefore if you want to deliver a new feature expect it to take several iterations before it reaches maturity and is ready for production.
