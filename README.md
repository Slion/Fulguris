Fulguris is a web browser for Android. Through a customizable interface it offers a premium experience on a range of Android, Chromebook and Windows 11 devices.

Being WebView-based makes it faster than any normal browser on older or low-end smartphones, while increasing loading speeds with every feature enabled.

Despite working great on older devices, this browser has a lot of features, including some not implemented in other mobile browsers, which makes Fulguris ideal for daily use on any device.

## Release channels
We have three official public release channels linked above and described below. While we strive to produce stable releases, the Fulguris project is a very small operation. Ultimately the community is responsible for doing the testing and validation of releases.

All three variants of the app can be installed at the same time on your device. They are effectively three distinct similar apps. You can differenciate them in your launcher from their slightly modified icon design. Which versions you use and how you manage your updates will define your experience with Fulguris.

Update often to help catch bugs before they reach too many users. Wait a couple of weeks and check for known issues before updating if you want to have fewer surprises and a more stable experience.

### üü¢ Google Play

Considered the most stable release channel. Optional [Firebase] statistics and crash report.
If you have more than twenty tabs in a session, it will gently remind you to go for the low cost yearly subscription, every time you open a new tab.

### üü° Download 

Provides release candidates and stable releases. Optional [Firebase] statistics and crash report.
Unlimited tabs without subscription. From here you get the most up to date versions.

### üü† F-Droid

Provides release candidates and stable releases. No [Firebase] statistics and crash report. Unlimited tabs without subscription.
We have no direct control of the release schedule on this channel. If a broken release reaches it, it may take a couple of weeks to fix it.

## Code
Code contributions are of course welcome, both bug fix and features.
Please understand that code quality, design and architecture are extremely important as the foremost priority of this project is to deliver a premium browsing experience.
We do our best to avoid treating users as beta testers. Therefore if you want to deliver a new feature expect it to take several iterations before it reaches maturity and is ready for production.
