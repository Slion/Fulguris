android:scrollbarThumbVertical="@drawable/scrollbar"
android:scrollbarThumbHorizontal="@drawable/scrollbar"
    WebView layout we had to use to be able to define our scrollbars color.
    Attempt to modify scrollbar color after creating our WebView object failed.

android:focusableInTouchMode="true"
    Not sure what than bring so we removed it

android:defaultFocusHighlightEnabled="false"
    This is needed to remove the focus highlight filtering on the whole web page whenever it is focused
    Not sure what happens then with version

android:background="?android:attr/colorBackground"
        We don't need to set our background here as we do it at runtime, on multiple occasions too.
        Also people reported it ain't working anyway.
        See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/7617734/3969362

<!--
Our scrollbars are always on top of the WebView content.
Looks like this one has not effect:
    android:scrollbarStyle="insideInset"

Those work:
    android:scrollbarSize="10dp"
    android:fadeScrollbars="false"
